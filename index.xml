      <description>I always wanted to write a year in review post, but never got around to it.
I wasn&amp;rsquo;t originally going to write this as I thought not much happened this year, but when I summed up a lot of small things that happened this year, I realised its worth writing about.
Towards better fitness I made drastic changes in my viewpoint and lifestyle with aspect to my diet and health which helped me lose my weight from 73.</description>

      <description>With the advancements in the world of containers, it is now much easier and feasible for you to deploy containerized applications.
Docker is a utility to efficiently create, ship, and run containers. They enable isolation and portability of application. However, one of the challenges of building docker images is to hold down the image size. One of the most effective ways to optimise the image sizes is to use multi stage builds.</description>

      <title>Coloring supervisor</title>

      <description>What is supervisor Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.
Why I colored it I use supervisor a lot (the organization I work for uses supervisor a lot), so this meant, from time to time I had to do supervisorctl status and read the output.
I was always jealous of the JS folks as they had their pm2 which made things colorful and pretty by default.</description>

      <description>This post was originally written on lambda.grofers.com
Currently at Grofers we are growing rapidly. And with this rapid-growth comes a huge amount of data. As we all know the (not so) famous saying:
 With great amount of data comes an itching need to analyse it.
 As the size of our data is growing rapidly, we have to analyse the trends that push our product forward.
We use PostgreSQL as our primary datastore.</description>

      <description>This post is about how me and Avijit retrieved multiplie cyberoam username/password combinations using python. This also highlights how vulnerable the system is if you are not using a more secure password . Even the default password given to us by the College are being recycled for many years.
DISCLAIMER Before you read this, I want to clarify that we do not intend to use our findings in any unethical way.</description>
