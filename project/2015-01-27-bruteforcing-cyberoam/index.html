      <h1>Bruteforcing Cyberoam</h1>
    </header>

    <p>This post is about how me and <a href="https://twitter.com/526avijit">Avijit</a> retrieved multiplie cyberoam username/password combinations using python. This also highlights how vulnerable the system is if you are not using a more secure password . Even the default password given to us by the College are being recycled for many years.</p>
<h3 id="disclaimer">DISCLAIMER</h3>
<p>Before you read this, I want to clarify that we do not intend to use our findings in any unethical way. No username-password combinations will be disclosed. The purpose of writing this blog was to notify possible victims to prevent their ID from being used by someone else.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-cyberoam-">What is Cyberoam ?</h3>
<p>Its a network gateway software which requires students to login to use the internet.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-did-it-">How we did it ?</h2>
<p>I wrote a simple python script which basically sends multiple requests to the server with varying username &amp; password combinations. It checks whether the combination is correct and if it is correct , the combination is stored in a file. I wrote that script to iterate over 2000 users and check 16 passwords, basically sending around 32,000 requests.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-got-the-usernames-">How we got the usernames ?</h3>
<p>It was simple. The college keeps a record of the marks obtained by the students with their enrollment number(username) and keeps it in the file-server (which is open to all the students).</p>
<p>Avijit did a little search around and was able to compile a list of all the 1st year students by going through the data available in different department’s servers.</p>
<h3 id="how-we-got-the-passwords-">How we got the passwords ?</h3>
<p>We found out that the default passwords given by the college have a pattern, also the same passwords( a set of around 150–300 passwords) were being used every year.
So we asked around and compiled a list of those passwords for our script. We could acquire around 10 passwords out of those.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-script">Running the script</h2>
<p><img src="/images/bruteforce-cyberoam-shell.png" alt="A Screenshot of the script in action"></p>
<p>Before running the script we didn&rsquo;t have any high hopes, but on executing it, the outcome surprised us. We managed to get <strong>62 combinations</strong>.</p>
<p>Its sad to see that our user IDs are so easy to crack.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Our College uses Cyberoam. They control and monitor what we see and what we do not on the Internet. They give us a very very crappy speed for a Computer Science College. They block even the most harmless sites like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDb</a>.</p>
<p>The least they can do is to add some security. I am tired of hearing my other friends praising their college’s internet speed, saying how they can download a movie in minutes , where as I can’t even download online lectures without exceeding my limited quota.</p>
