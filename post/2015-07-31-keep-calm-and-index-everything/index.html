    <p>This post was originally written on lambda.grofers.com</p>
<p>Currently at Grofers we are growing rapidly. And with this rapid-growth comes a huge amount of data. As we all know the (not so) famous saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>With great amount of data comes an itching need to analyse it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the size of our data is growing rapidly, we have to analyse the trends that push our product forward.</p>
<p>We use <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> as our primary datastore. We store our data in a pretty normalised way and for doing analysis, we have to perform various aggregations. Since our data is very normalised, we have to do a lot of JOINS for performing the level of aggregations we need which were not RDS friendly.</p>
<p>So we decided to search for alternatives. After pondering over various alternatives , we finally decided that <strong>elasticsearch</strong> will solve most of our problems.</p>
<p>It was decided then, <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> it is. But then came a bigger problem, how can we index so much data onto <strong>Elasticsearch</strong> and that too <strong>realtime</strong>.</p>
<p>We didn’t want to do this just by throwing more servers to the problem. So first we thought of using <strong>celery</strong>.</p>
<p>The flow using <strong>celery</strong> was:</p>
<ol>
<li>On every post-save, we would create an elasticsearch document.</li>
<li>We would index that document using an asynchronous task through celery.</li>
<li>This would go on and on for all the data we recieved.</li>
</ol>
<p>But there were a few problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our elasticsearch kept timing out due to the heavy load.</li>
<li>This process was also heavy on the database.</li>
</ul>
<p>After that we decided to use something other than <strong>celery</strong> for our data indexing.</p>
<h2 id="hello-gearman">Hello Gearman</h2>
<p><strong>Gearman</strong> is an application framework that allows you to hand over heavy tasks to different workers.</p>
<p>Gearman has 3 important parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client Server</li>
<li>Job/Worker Server</li>
<li>Daemon</li>
</ul>
<p>The client server would send data to the job server through its daemon. Then that job server would perform those tasks. The tasks can be done both synchronously and asynchronously.</p>
<p>In our scenario, the client server was our API which was written in <strong>python</strong>. We then built our Job Server around <strong>node.js</strong> .</p>
<p>The flow was pretty much awesome:</p>
<ol>
<li>We would send the <code>id</code> and <code>job_name</code> to the <strong>gearman</strong> daemon.</li>
<li>The daemon would pass on the data to our job server.</li>
<li>Our job server would query the required data from our read replica.</li>
<li>It will then create a document with that data and indexes it on <strong>elasticsearch</strong> using it’s bulk API.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we are processing data at an incredible pace and our analytics team is in the process of generating great outcome.</p>
<p>We used gearman for asynchronous tasks, but it can be used in many ways. It can also be used as an alternative to <strong>Apache Thrift</strong>. You can push your performance critical code to other languages like <strong>C++</strong> or <strong>Golang</strong>.</p>
<p>To conclude all my thoughts, the indexing problem was indeed a good challenge and gearman was a great solution.</p>
