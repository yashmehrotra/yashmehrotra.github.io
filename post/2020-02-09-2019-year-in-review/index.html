    </header>

    <p>I always wanted to write a year in review post, but never got around to it.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t originally going to write this as I thought not much happened this year, but when I summed up a lot of small things that happened this year, I realised its worth writing about.</p>
<h2 id="towards-better-fitness">Towards better fitness</h2>
<p>I made drastic changes in my viewpoint and lifestyle with aspect to my diet and health which helped me lose my weight from 73.4 kgs to 60.6 kgs</p>
<p>It was both a combination of eating healthy and working out more often.</p>
<p><strong>Things I quit:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sugar (Milkshakes, Chocolates, Sodas, Ice creams)</li>
<li>Junk food (Pizzas, burgers, fried food)</li>
<li>Ice creams</li>
<li>Sweets and desserts (I was never much of a sweet tooth anyway)</li>
</ul>
<p>Its not that I quit these things altogether, they are still consumed on the occasational cheat day.</p>
<p><strong>Things I ate instead of those:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Salads</li>
<li>Preferred healthier options when eating out</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from eating healthy, I made a habit of working out in the morning. I didn&rsquo;t join a gym since I wanted to be regular with a routine first. This started out with a daily cardio of 20 minutes.
Along with that, I also played football 2-3 times a week, and sometimes badminton too. Sports are a great way to take your mind off things and unwind.
The next step for me is being a regular in gym.</p>
<p>With all these, a few other improvements I saw was increased stamina, core-strength and an increase in pace.</p>
<p>Improving my eating habits doing basic cardio execrises daily for 20-25 minutes was the key.</p>
<h2 id="new-gig-new-city">New gig, new city</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Change is the only constant in life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Change is something you cannot avoid, so why not embrace it. Having never been at a single place for more than 3-4 years, I decided it was time to move on, again. With a clean slate, I found myself in Pune, the cultural capital of Maharashtra.</p>
<p>From the weather standpoint, it was a total win. Along with much cleaner air you get a seasonal pleasant weather, where winters are not too chilly and summers not that hot. For someone coming from Delhi, this is the dream. I was able to see a starry night after a long time.</p>
<p><img src="/images/baner-hill.jpeg" alt="View from Baner Hill"></p>
<p>My city was not the only thing that I changed, I changed my job profile as well. Ever since my first internship, I have always been a <strong>Backend Engineer</strong>. So when I was offered a role as a <strong>Devops Engineer</strong>, it caught me offguard.</p>
<p>Ever since my humble beginning, I was always interested in the infrastructure aspect but had never given it a hard thought until then. After some careful consideration, I decided it was a new opportunity and a good way to explore the uncharted.</p>
<h3 id="food">Food</h3>
<p>The only downside I have faced after moving is the food. While the food here is savory, it does not match the number of options and quality you had in Delhi and Gurgaon.</p>
<p>Albeit, there are plentiful of enjoyable cafes and restaurants here, it is not easy to find good eating joints, however the search will always go on.</p>
<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>Music is another thing Pune is good at. There are a lot cafes with live music here. Having lived only a few months in Pune, I went to the Weekeneder festival and a Prateek Kuhad concert, both of which were amazing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> At Weekender, I met colleagues from my previous office, a friend from college, and 2 long lost friends from different schools. (For a moment, it fooled my current friends into thinking that I am exteremly popular)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/images/prateek-kuhad.jpg" alt="Prateek Kuhad"></p>
<p>With a very happening music scene, I look forward to seeing many more artists live here.</p>
<h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
<p>One of my major regrets of 2019 were not being able to travel as much as I had hoped. Due to lot of moving parts, a few of my planned trips got cancelled. The only noteworthy place I went to was at the end of the year to Murud, Kashid and Diveagar beaches in Maharashtra.</p>
<p><img src="/images/diveagar-beach.jpg" alt="Sunsets and silhouettes"></p>
<p>I have big travel plans in 2020, which hopefully will pan out well.</p>
<h2 id="plans-for-2020">Plans for 2020</h2>
<ul>
<li>The top of the list is travelling more. My goal is to have atleast 1 overseas trip and 3 domestic trips.</li>
<li>Start playing the piano more often. Playing music was a hobby of mine which got left behind. The aim is to be more regular and proficient in playing.</li>
<li>Unfortunately in 2019, I did not write a single blog. I am trying to make journalling a part of my life and hope to write more posts this year.</li>
<li>Read more books. My <em>to read</em> list is ever increasing, and I plan to take out more time aside for books.</li>
</ul>
