## The need for privacy

> Why should I care about privacy, I have nothing to hide

A few years back, this question was very difficult to answer. People always took<wording> privacy in the physical sense. No one understood the concept, let alone be scared<wording> of it.

If you wouldn't want a stranger enter your home uninvited, why do you treat your digital world any different. To argue, your digital world contains more private things like conversations, interactions, interests and transactions.

Fortunately, as the times changed, people's mindset too. They started realising that the lives they live digitally have significance too. And those, who still weren't quite convinced, Facebook and Google played a major role to tell them their privacy is actually at stake<wording>

With FAAG buying every company that threatens them, they are centralising data. Google - Fitbit example

You don't want all this data to be linked. Give china example

## Why an eventual compromise is the answer

Going off the grid is not easy. Nor is going away from the entire ecosystem.

Eventual compromise means deciding to use some of it, but only restrict to that. Doing a trade-off and making your peace with it.

The reality is that choosing not to use these services come at a great cost of convienience, and while there are some extermists who have gone the distance, its not easy. You aren't expected to. To successfully do this, you not only need to convince yourself, but even your friends and family to consider making the switch. As much as you may disgust Facebook, you may have to use whatsapp because everyone else already does, and it is more of a necessity now.

This is where trade-offs and calculated risks come in place.

Assume everything you post is public or use a privacy respecting tool

## Evaluation criteria

Everyone has a different framework when it comes to choosing the tool to use.

Some people value ease of use whilst others may value integrations with different software.

Some would value privacy over functionaliy, others may not.

Some people prefer to go for self-hosted tools where as a major chunk can't.

This depends on person to person and usecase to usecase, think one of your own.

While deciding, also keep in mind the privacy laws of your country (esp. Key disclosure law) and whether the service you are using is part of 5-9-14 eyes (link to privacy tools.io)

## Tools I use

### Browser: Firefox

Extensions:

- Multi-account containers (great for separating personal, work, google etc.)
- uBlock origin: Block all the unwanted trackers

Use ingonito mode if you are just browsing and don't want a persistent session

### Storage

- I personally use pCloud, (least of all the evils)
- ProtonDrive is releasing soon and that also seems promising
- If you want to self-host Nextcloud and Syncthing are good
- Just do not go for Google Drive, iCloud or OneDrive
- Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: At least 3 copies of your data in 2 different locations, 1 of which needs to be off-site

### Email

- Gmail due to legacy reasons
- Slowly moving to Protonmail for primary mail.

### Communication

- Signal: Moxie knows his shit
- Avoid WhatsApp, Facebook will eventually get rid of the end-to-end encryption
- Fun story: After selling Whatsapp to Facebook, the founder Brian Acton was assured that end-to-end encryption won't be removed and they'll figure other ways to monetize it. Then, some events transpired, which ended up with Brian Acton tweeting: Fuck facebook and proceeded to donate $50 million USD to Open Whisper Foundation (Signal's Parent org)
- This clearly means that he knows something that we all don't

### Password management

- Use a password manager. Period.
- Use different passwords for different websites so that in case one company's database gets breached, you wouldn't have to worry about other websites
- I personally advocate for Bitwarden, but Lastpass and 1password are good too.

## Social media

- It may be hard to do, but get off Facebook. It went from being a good social media platform to be upto date with your peers but now it has turned into a cesspool where propaganda, hate speech and controversies are promoted over your friend's updates since they provide more engagement. Luckily for me, most of my close circle just stopped it after college and it's charm died pretty fast. I went to Facebook after a few months to research for this article and all I saw was shared posts of other pages by friends with a sponsored post every 4th or 5th tile <wording>

General website etiquette:

- You need to stop sharing unnecessary details
  - If a site asks for your birthday or gender, don't give it
  - Don't fill out all the details of the profile page unless functioning of the website is being effected
  - Use temp-mail.org to get temp emails

# Extra

China’s state surveillance has an eye on literally each and every move  of its inhabitants, whether physical or digital. The state uses  extensive data to allocate social scores, which can have a [drastic impact](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-09-18/china-social-credit-a-model-citizen-in-a-digital-dictatorship/10200278?nw=0) on Chinese people’s life, including banning them from purchasing train  or plane tickets, providing them with lower Internet speed, and denying  them visas and loans
