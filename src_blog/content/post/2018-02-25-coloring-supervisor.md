### What is supervisor

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

### Why I colored it

I use supervisor a lot (the organization I work for uses supervisor a lot), so this meant, from time to time I had to do `supervisorctl status` and read the output.

I was always jealous of the JS folks as they had their [**pm2**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2) which made things colorful and pretty by default.

So, this weekend, I spent around 1 hour to do justice by supervisor.

I used `tabulate` and `crayons` to convert the output in a tabular format and color it respectively. I also used `psutil` to get CPU and memory usage as well. So, here is the final outcome.
